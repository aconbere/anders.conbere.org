Silver gelatin printing is the most common process for black and white analog printing. There are a good number of modern papers in many different formulations and papers. Papers can be found in either Resin Coated or Fiber variants.

Fiber papers the emulsion is applied on top of a fine art paper (often made of cotton). These papers exhibit a noted tooth or texture, it tends to give images a "rich" depth. Fiber papers absorb the development chemicals and take longer to wash and dry. They tend to be thicker and dry with a wrinkle.

Resin coated papers the emulsion sits on top of a thin layer of plastic (resin) that coats the paper. As such the paper is thinner, dries faster, and lacks the texture of fiber based papers.
