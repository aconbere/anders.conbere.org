The photographic enlarger is a tool used to project a negative onto a piece of photographic paper.

Typically an enlarger is layed out top to bottom as follows:

Light Source - Commonly either a condensor or a diffusion light source. 
Filter Holder - Puts a contrast filter in the light path (with color enlarger heads this is a little different).
Negative Carrier - Keeps the negative flat and positioned in the light path
Lens - Focuses the negative onto the stage
Stage - Holds the paper being exposed (often in an [easel](@/wiki/easel.md))
