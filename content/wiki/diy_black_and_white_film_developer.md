## Instant Mytol I

From [Photosensitive.com](https://photosensitive.ca/#easy-developers)

Can be mixed with a base of water or triethanolamine 

### Water

- 750ml water
- 60g sodium sulfite (anhydrous)
- 11.5 g ascorbic acid
- 0.15 g phenidone (pre-dissolved in alcohol to aid dissolution)
- 13.4 ml triethanolamine or 7 g sodium metaborate
- Water to 1 L

### Triethanolamine

- 13.4 ml hot triethanolamine
- 25 ml hot propylene glycol
- 11.5 g ascorbic acid
- 0.15 g phenidone

Note: It will take quite a while, and may require the addition of 1-2 ml of water. Dilute with hot propylene glycol to a final volume of 50 ml.


### Use

For use, dilute 1+19 with water containing 60 g/L sodium sulfite the resulting solution matches the activity of stock XTOL. To create something like XTOL 1+1, dilute 1+39 with water containing 30 g/L sodium sulfite.


## Instant Mytol II

Recipe is per 250ml, phenidone should be mixed to a 2.5% solution in propylene glycol. Use the same times as Xtol, can be used stock or 1:1.

- 100ml [Proplyene Glycol](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/propylene-glycol-part-1318)
- 15g [Sodium Sulfite](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/sodium-sulfite-anhy-part-1416)
- 350mg [Borax](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/borax-part-1070)
- 1.4g Washing Soda
- 2.875g [Ascorbic Acid](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/ascorbic-acid-part-1639)
- 1.5g 2.5% [Phenidone](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/phenidone-a-part-1200)

Times treated identical to Xtol

## PC-512 Borax

From [relistan](https://imager.ie/a-simple-phenidone-ascorbic-acid-concentrate-developer/) more discussion at [Photrio.com](https://www.photrio.com/forum/threads/my-pc-512-borax-developer.195379/)

### Solution A (100ml)
- 100ml [Proplyene Glycol](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/propylene-glycol-part-1318)
- 12g [Ascorbic Acid](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/ascorbic-acid-part-1639)
- 0.5g [Phenidone](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/phenidone-a-part-1200)

Heat 80ml of Propylene Glycol to 80C (or so). Add Ascorbic Acid in small amounts while stirring (Note: This can take 15-20 minutes of hand stirring). Add Phenidone and stir / heat until fully dissolved. Top with Propylene Glycol to 100ml.

### Solution B (1 liter)

- 1L water
- 21.7g Borax (Mule Team is fine)

Dissolve Borax in 800ml of water, top to 1L when fully dissolved.

### Use

Mix 1:50 solution A to solution B. For example: For about 300ml of developer mix 6ml of solution A to 300ml of solution B.

## Mocon

From [Mark Overton](https://fixfilmcamera.com/Mocon/Mocon.html) or his article on [Photrio](https://www.photrio.com/forum/resources/mocon-xtol-quality-in-a-long-lasting-concentrate.219/), an extra long lasting Xtol clone that keeps as a frozen concentrate.

- 12.2g (11.8ml) [Propylene glycol](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/propylene-glycol-part-1318)
- 1.8g [Sodium metaborate 4 mol](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/sodium-metaborate-bal-alkali-part-1385)
- 4.2g [Ascorbic Acid](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/ascorbic-acid-part-1639)
- 0.08g Dimezone S (Alternatively .05 g Phenidone)

Mixing the concentrate at 75C add each ingredient one at a time until fully disolved. Should take between 20-25 minutes. Suggestion is to mix in batches and stored in as small a container as possible to avoid oxidation.

Preparing a working solution (1L)

- 18g of concentrate
- 45 g of sodium sulfite

Add water to 1L and and stir until dissolved (about 3.5 min at 20C).
