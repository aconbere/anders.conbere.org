## Mocon

From [Mark Overton](https://fixfilmcamera.com/Mocon/Mocon.html) or his article on [Photrio](https://www.photrio.com/forum/resources/mocon-xtol-quality-in-a-long-lasting-concentrate.219/), an extra long lasting Xtol clone that keeps as a frozen concentrate.

- 12.2g (11.8ml) [Propylene glycol](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/propylene-glycol-part-1318)
- 1.8g [Sodium metaborate 4 mol](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/sodium-metaborate-bal-alkali-part-1385)
- 4.2g [Ascorbic Acid](https://artcraftchemicals.com/products/ascorbic-acid-part-1639)
- 0.08g Dimezone S (Alternatively .05 g Phenidone)

Mixing the concentrate at 75C add each ingredient one at a time until fully disolved. Should take between 20-25 minutes. Suggestion is to mix in batches and stored in as small a container as possible to avoid oxidation.

Preparing a working solution (1L)

- 18g of concentrate
- 45 g of sodium sulfite

Add water to 1L and and stir until dissolved (about 3.5 min at 20C).
