## Mamiya Press

Manufactured: 1960-1967

An original Mamiya Press model. I got this camera along with an Olympus OM-2 on trade for fixing a fellow's TurboExpress. I have most often used this camera with the multiformat back in 6x4.5 mode and it's actually pretty nice like that.

## Mamiya Press "Crop Top"

Manufactured: 1960-1967

Once an original model Mamiya Press that I got for very cheap from ebay then dissassembled to remove the top and ragefinder. Now it's a kind of glorified 6x9 point and shoot. Zone focus with the 50mm or 65mm lenses. It's a little bit smaller and a little bit lighter and a little bit more mobile than my other press cameras. It can be a nice way to have a little bit of fun with the lenses.

## Mamiya Universal Press

Manufactured: 1969-1980

It's big and heavy and a little bit ackward, but for some reason I love it.

## Mamiya RB67

An exceptional camera, with some steller lenses.
