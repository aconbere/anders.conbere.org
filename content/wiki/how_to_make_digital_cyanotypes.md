title = "How To Make A Digital Cyanotype"
+++

Cyanotype is a method of print making that has many advantages to a modern printer. It's easy, cheap, produces high quality images, and can be toned into many colors beyond its natural blue.

The cyanotype process is most sensitive to UV and fairly slow, makding it unsuitable to use with traditional enlargers. Given that our best method for making larger prints is to make contact prints. Historically this meant that in order to make large prints you had to make large negatives, but with the advent of high quality inkjet printers we're able to print a high resolution digital transparency and use that instead. As print makers this gives us all of the powers of digital processing; digital editing, collage, adjustments; At the cost of having to sit in front of a computer.

Once you have a transparency, making a cyanotype isn't complicated. First the paper is coated. Starting with a suitable paper the sensitizzer is spread onto the paper and then the paper is dried. Then the print is exposed. The transparency is squeezed against the sensitized paper and exposed to bright UV light. Then the print is developed. Washing it in a bath of acidified water, then a bath of dilute hydrogen peroxide, then finally a long wash of running tap water. Finally the print is dried. At the end you should have a lovely bright blue print.

## Materials

- Printing Frame - A printing frame is a tool that holds the negative to the sensitized paper. On the cheapest end you can get by with a heavy piece of glass, on the most expensive are fancy hand made wood frames.
- 365nm UV Light - Cyanotype is a UV process, traditionally you might use the sun, but it's inconsistent (especially here in the northwest winters). A 365nm UV light goes a long way to making this process simpler.
- Glass plate - Something large enough for your print to sit on while coating
- Paper - There are endless variants of fine arts papers to expirement with, I predominantly work with [Arches Platine 145gsm](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1714199-REG/arches_c08_523_705_arches_145_gsm_platine.html), but there are a ton great options. Take a look at Christina Anderson's [MASSIVE Paper Chart](https://www.alternativephotography.com/massive-paper-chart/) for ideas on what works best.
- Sensitizer - There are two formulations of cyanotype in wide use today: Classic two part cyanotype, and Mike Ware's "new" one part. Which you use is up to you, I use the new variant, I'll include ingredients for both below.
- Brush - There are a handful of ways to coat paper but a brush is probably the most common. I like to use a [japenese hake brush](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049UZJUI?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) but lots of folks like foam brushes. Importantly don't choose a brush with metal ferules as they can react with the sensitizer.
- Trays - Three [low trays](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/40359-REG/Paterson_PTP334_Plastic_Developing_Trays.html) that fit your print.
- Clothes Pins - Plastic, for hanging your prints.
- Citric Acid - Used in the first wash, helps prevent washout.
- Scale - Accurate to 0.01g, after trying a number, I really like the [american weigh scales](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005UGBG20?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2).
- [Brown Glass Bottles 100mm](https://www.amazon.com/AOZITA-Dropper-Bottles-Funnels-Labels/dp/B0BVMCVHZ8?crid=1O3O1TO6KJCF1) - I got mine at the UW surplus store 
- [100mm Graduated Cylinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLHDVC1N)
- Tween 20 - [A common surfectant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLSX62PH?ref_=ppx_hzod_title_dt_b_fed_asin_title_0_0), it can help with sensitizer penitration

## Making a Digital Transparency

## Preparing the Paper

Before coating there is some work to be done with the paper. If your paper isn't already cut to the right size you'll want to spend some time deciding what size print you want to make and ensuring your negative looks nice on it. I take this time to make some notes in pencil, this does two things, first many papers have different tooth on both sides. This is the time where I pick what is the front or the back, and making a note will help me remember when it comes time to coat.

This is also the time where I'll make note of the hummidity. I've found that paper that is excessively dry or wet wont take sensitizer properly and you can end up with issues in the print. If the room is below 40% relative hummidity I'll let the paper sit on a screen over a tray of warm water for 30 - 40 minutes before coating.

## Preparing your coating station

Materials:
- Sensitizer
- Paper
- Brush
- Clothes Pins
- Citric Acid
- Tween 20
- Glass Plate
- Distilled Water
- paper towl

The first thing I do is I get out my brush and I place it in a small bowl of distilled water and move it around to knock out all the air bubbles. This helps hydrate the brush so that it doesn't absorb all the sensitizer.

Next I prepare my sensitizer for coating, using new cyanotype, I measure aproximately 2ml of sensitizer per 8x10 print, then add 1 drop of tween 20 and 1 drop of citric acid solution for every ml of sensitizer. I then swirl this mixture for a while to ensure that it's well mixed.

Now I lay my paper out on the glass sheet. I take my brush out of the water, running it over the edge of the bowl to remove excess water, then I paint 1 or two strokes on the paper towel to further dry the brush.Then I just touch the tip of the brush into the sensitizer.

## Coating your paper

With the sensitized brush, starting a the top left of my print area, moving left to rigt top to bottom and begin to coat the print in light (almost no pressure), smooth, medium speed strokes. If at any point the brush gets dry I return it to the sensitizer and continue. When I've coated the full print area, I rotate the print counter clockwise and begin again, top to bottom, left to right. At this point I angle the print in the bias and do one more final pass top the bottom left to right.

Some things to watch out for:
- Bubbles: Worse with tween 20 than without, more common when brushing too quickly, don't panic just do a couple of slow brushes through them to remove.
- Brush Bristles: I've found just a tiny bit of paper towel can help lift them out, again not the end of the world if they're in there, but nice to get out.
- Puddling: Don't let big wet puddles sit on the page, if your brush is just too wet there's no hope grab a paper towel. Better to remove puddles than let them linger. They'll dry weird and you'll end up with artfacts where they sat.

Once your print is coated hang it from a line with the clothes pin and let it sit for about an hour or until it is dry and cool to the touch.

## Exposing the print
