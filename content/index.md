title: About Anders
---

I live in Seattle with my wife Mollie, daughter Matia, son Hamilton, and my two dogs Mr. P and Gary. I like to play video games, lift weights, read SciFi / Fantasy novels, and repair old electronics. I currently work at [Moment](https://www.moment.dev) as a software engineer.
