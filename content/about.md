I am a black and white film photographer and print maker living in Seattle WA. This site is a place for me to catalog my [thoughts](@/blog/_index.md), my [photography](@/photography/_index.md), and to help organize [photography knowledge](@/wiki/_index.md).

You might also find me writing about software, electronics, camera repair, books I read, games I'm playing, weight lifting, and just tinkering with or fixing stuff.
