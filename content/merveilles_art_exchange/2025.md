title="Merveilles Art Exchange: 2025"
+++

Hello Merveillians,

My name is <a href="https://anders.conbere.org/">Anders</a> and this year I am organizing a merveilles art exchange.

The idea is simple: Sign up by sending an email to <a mailto="merveilles_art_exchange_2025@conbere.org">merveilles_art_exchange_2025@conbere.org</a> with your name and address. Then on Aug 1st I will randomly (and secretly) assign every participant another member to send a piece of art of their own creation. Feel free to share what you received on mastodon with the tag #MerveillesArtExchange2025.

The goal of this activity is to celebrate and share each other's art and creativity. There are no rules about what qualifies as art, no expectations on price of the work, only that every participant share a physical piece of art that they put time and effort into creating. It could be a drawing, a print, a poem, a piece of pottery.

Please let me know if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions either by way of email, mastodon, or discord.

- Anders
