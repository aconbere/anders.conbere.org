title="Year In Review - 2025"

+++

So much of my adult life, every year could be neatly summarized by "did my job, cooked dinner, raised babies". I don't think there was much value in summarizing that life. But this year, in all of the freedom of not working a 9-5 job I feel detached from time. When reading Rek's [year in review](https://kokorobot.ca/site/2025dec31.html) I found myself wondering "Gosh, what did happen this year?". I was surprised! It's been a busy year, and much of it if you asked me I would have said happened over a year ago!

## Things I Read

- Black Leopard Red Wolf - Marlon James
- Moon Witch Spider King - Marlon James
- Our Game - John Le Carre
- Chief Seattle and the Town That Took His Name - David M Buege
- A Long Way To A Small Angry Planet - Becky Chambers
- Blindness - Jose Saramango
- Dr. Jeckyll and Mr Hyde - Robert Louis Stevenson

Black Leopard Red Wolf knocked my socks off! I couldn't stop telling people about it. It is very hard to recommend to people without some caveats. It is violent, sexy, gay, terrible, and glorious. It is a strange fever dream of a book, filled with a mythos that I've never known about.

## Things I watched

- Portrait of a Lady on Fire
- Past Lives
- Sorcerer
- Weapons
- Ikiru
- The Substance
- Sinners

I absolutely loved Portrait of a Lady on Fire, probably my personal favorite of the year. Not at all a movie in my normal genre. I would never reach for a period drama. But I found this to be just a lovely piece and absolutely smouldering romance. Beautiful work. Sorcerer was another surprise, having been underwhelmed by The Wages of Fear I didn't have high hopes, but I thought Sorcerer was a better movie in every way, and what impressive practical effects! It was a lot of fun to watch Ikiru at Cinerama with my friend's Matt and Beth. I'm out of the norm and didn't care for Sinners or The Substance.

## Things I Played

- Caves of Qud
- Monster Hunter Rise (again!)
- Dark Souls
- Dark Souls II
- Bloodborne
- Sekiro

I kicked off the year by playing Caves of Qud. It was a real adventure! Balancing narative, deep simulation game play, and intricate hidden systems. I loved it. I came back to Monster Hunter playing through the main game again with my sister Thea. It was a lovely way to spend time together and stay in touch. And I broke through my FromSoft blockage. I really enjoyed all of them, but probably BloodBorne the most. Sekiro I haven't finished, I think it's a beautiful game, and I like being in the world, but the boss battles are punishing.

## Other fun stuff

- Hosted a Merveilles art exchange
- Threw a neighborhood block party
- Repaired so many things:
    - Jet 8" Jointer
    - Ilex No 5 shutter
    - Ilex Optimo Shutter
    - Mamiya Press 65mm
    - Mamiya Press Universal Body
    - Wollensak Alphax No 4 Shutter
    - Minolta Autocord
    - Voigtlander Vito B
    - Voigtlander Perkeo
    - Random Russian Shutter

## Next Year

Looking forward I would like to find ways to spend more time working with other people. I tapered off most of my classes at PCNW this year, focusing instead on my own work at home. But as a consequence I spent a lot of this year alone. Collaboration is a perenial challenge, maybe this year I'll make some progress on it! By the end of 2026 I'd like to have produced a collection of prints to hang for a show. I've been working on a larger collection of images for a photobook and I'd like to have that in a good place. Finally I'd like to bring more drawing into my regular practice, I really enjoyed the class I took but I haven't found the way to bring it into my regular life yet. Overall I'm excited for another year!
