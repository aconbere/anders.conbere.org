Lately I've been playing around a bit with the (r3Ddragon)[https://github.com/mrdanielps/r3Ddragon] Virtual Boy emulator for the Nintendo 3DS. The 3DS is a unique and interesting emulation target for the Virtual Boy because it's one of the few emulation tarets that could emulate both the machine and it's steroscopic 3D display. This manages to combine a few of my obsessions: the Nintendo 3DS and obscure video game hardware so ... what was a boy to do?

When I pulled the latest r3Ddragon source it wasn't building, so I fixed up some small issues, upgraded some libraries and added some tooling support.
