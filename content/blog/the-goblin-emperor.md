The Goblin Emperor is a 2014 novel by Katherine Addison. While built on a high fantasy setting of elves and goblins, the central story could be found in any court drama set in Europe. A young half goblin prince is exiled when his father marries a younger wife and bears new heirs. When a freak accident kills the king and his heir the young prince is thrust into the court with no training and few allies, drama ensues. But ultimately this book shines with it's excellent characters, the young prince Maia in particular, exudes so much warmth and kindness that you can't help but root for him.

I thought this novel was lovely, a true tale about how kindness can win.
