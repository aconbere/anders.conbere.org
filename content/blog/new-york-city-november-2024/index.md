The family and I spent a week in New York City this month. Our last big vacation as a family we went to Guadalajara and completely failed to make it any fun for the kids. So with that in mind we set out to try to ensure that every day there was something that was going to be fun for the kids.

We spent a bit of time in New York back when Matia was a baby (she took her first steps in the Etsy offices!) but haven't been back much since then. It was great to visit friends and family and to do a bunch of touristy stuff that we would never both to do if the kids weren't with us.

I brought my OM-2S for something that would be versitile and easy to shoot while on the move. I brought HP5+ and Acros II but only ended up shooting the HP5, and it's a good thing, because I seem to have really gravitated to shooting at night.

Unfortunately the camera seems to have developed some issues. A light leak on the top right of the frame is from some pinholes in the first shutter curtain. And some dramatic shutter capping. I went and checked I did see the pinholes in shots from this summer, but the capping is new behavior.

The pinholes I've patched with a dab of acrylic, the capping will need some surgery. Often capping can be solved by cleaning and lubricating the curtain bearings. However the OM-2S is so crammed with electronics up top that it will be a royal pain to get into.
