title: Work History
---

I've been writing software professionally since 2005, in that time I've mostly focused on working with small to midsized companies. I'm a generalist and I have done everything from shipping software that ran on medical devices to high scale data ingestion to highly dynamic websites. I have very few preferences for languages but prefer unix like environments to windows, and prefer languages that focus on correctness over those that focus on developer productivity.

My [full resume](resume/resume.yml) provides more details.
