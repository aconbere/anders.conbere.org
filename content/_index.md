I live in Seattle with my wife Mollie, daughter Matia, son Hamilton, and my two dogs Mr. P and Gary.


I like to [fix old cameras](./tags/camera-repair), [play video games](./tags/video-games), lift weights, [read books](./tags/books), and [repair old electronics](./tags/electronics).

I've historically made money working as a software developer, but I'm currently taking a break.

You can read about what's going on in my head in my [Blog](./blog)
