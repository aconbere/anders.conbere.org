I live in Seattle with my wife Mollie, daughter Matia, son Hamilton, and my dog Gary (R.I.P. Mr. P). I am a constant tinkerer and can often be found in my work shop repairing [cameras](./tags/camera-repair), [vintage electronics](./tags/electronics), or any number of things that come my way. I have historically made money writing software, but as of 2023 I have been taking an extended break.

Lately I have been learning the art and process of traditional black and white photography, from exposure to print. You can find some examples of my work on my [photography](./photography) page or follow along on various adventures on my [blog](./blog) (but it is infrequently updated).

You can reach me at [photography@conbere.org](mailto:photography@conbere.org) or follow me on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@aconbere).
