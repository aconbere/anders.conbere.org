I live in Seattle with my wife Mollie, daughter Matia, son Hamilton, and my dog Gary (R.I.P. Mr. P). I am a film photographer and print maker and I can often be found in my basement lab developing film or mixing strange chemicals. You can find examples of my work or buy prints on my [photography](./photography) page or dig through my [lab notes](./wiki). I am a constant tinkerer and love to repair [cameras](./tags/camera-repair), [vintage electronics](./tags/electronics), or any number of things that come my way. I have historically made money writing software, but as of 2023 I have been taking an extended break.

You can reach me at [photography@conbere.org](mailto:photography@conbere.org) or follow me on [mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@anders).
